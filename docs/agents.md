anyr for agents and scripts

Read this once, then call anyr without a TTY.

Discover
  anyr commands --json          Every command with its flags, subcommands,
                                aliases and whether it has JSON output
  anyr <command> --help         The full text for one command

Output
  --json                        JSON on stdout for every command that has a
                                JSON form. On any command, an error becomes one
                                JSON object on stderr:
                                {"error":{"code":"auth","exit":4,"message":"…","hint":"…"}}
  ANYR_OUTPUT=json              The same as passing --json to every command
  --quiet, ANYR_QUIET=1         No update notices and no background update
  NO_COLOR=1                    No ANSI colour (also off whenever stdout is not
                                a terminal)
  Without a TTY, anyr shows no prompts, spinners or update notices. Commands
  that would ask first need --yes.
